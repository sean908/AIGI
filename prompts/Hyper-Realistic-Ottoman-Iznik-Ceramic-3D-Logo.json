  "prompt": "Using the uploaded image as the exact visual base, transform it into a hyper-realistic 3D object that retains the original shape and proportions of the logo only. Apply traditional Ottoman Iznik ceramic textures—featuring a warm white glazed base with delicate crackle lines, overlaid with vivid cobalt blue, turquoise, and bold red floral motifs such as tulips, carnations, and arabesque vines. The entire logo should be treated as a standalone porcelain sculpture with raised, hand-painted detailing and no background plate or tile structure. Ensure the decorative patterns elegantly follow the contours of the logo, without altering its form. Render the object in a pure black background with Cinema 4D-style product lighting—highlighting realistic ceramic gloss, material depth, and subtle reflections. The final result should feel like a luxurious handcrafted ceramic reinterpretation, balancing heritage ornamentation with industrial branding.",
